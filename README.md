# RPS-Game
## Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a console-based implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. It allows the player to play against an AI opponent and keeps track of the scores throughout the game.

## Features
The game follows the traditional rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
The player can choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors) by inputting the corresponding keyword.
The AI opponent generates a random move.
After each round, the game displays the player's move, the AI's move, and the result of the round (player wins, AI wins, or tie).
The scores of the player and AI are updated based on the outcome of each round.
The game continues until either the player or the AI reaches a score of 3.
At the end of the game, the winner (player or AI) is declared, or a tie is announced if both scores are equal.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment.
Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
Run the application.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input your moves and play the game.
The game will continue until either the player or the AI reaches a score of 3.
At the end of the game, the winner or tie result will be displayed.

## Testing
The project includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the game logic. The test project (RPSGameTests) contains test methods to verify various scenarios, such as player wins, AI wins, and ties. The tests also include checking the correct update of scores after each round.

To run the unit tests:

Open the solution in your C# development environment.
Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
Open the Test Explorer window.
Run all tests or select specific tests to execute.
